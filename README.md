DASTAKHAT - A BLOCKCHAIN BASED IDENTITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM                              


This project is a decentralized application (dApp) that addresses the issue of data security in storage and data sharing, as well as data authenticity/credibility
in identity management systems. We are using Multichain, a fork of Bitcoin, to achieve a managed blockchain over which this application will be developed.

Modules
There are three modules for this application: the issuer's end, the verifier's end, and the user's end.

Issuer's End
The issuer can upload and save data securely. They can also issue verifiable credentials to their employees or any entity whom they are authorized to authenticate. These credentials will be stored in an e-wallet on the user's end and can be securely shared with any third party (the verifier).

Authenticator's End
The authenticator can verify the credentials issued by the issuer and confirm their authenticity with respect to the issuer who has issued/authorized said document or credentials.

User's End
The user can securely store and share their credentials with any third party (the verifier). The visibility of credentials can be limited according to the permissions assigned by the user.

Features
Secure data storage and sharing
Verifiable credentials
Limited visibility of credentials
Authenticity confirmation
Architecture
This application is built using Multichain, a fork of Bitcoin, to achieve a managed blockchain over which the application will be developed. The end application will constitute a web portal for issuers and verifiers' side and an e-wallet application for the users' side.
